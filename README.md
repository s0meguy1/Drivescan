# Drivescan
This is used to quickly scan for secrets in files on shared drives using regex to search for known sensitive signatures. Made so that it can run on both windows and linux for portability


In the releases section you will find compiled binary files for both Linux and Windows. This is so that the files can be easily copied to a system without having to install the dependancies (mainly textract)

ToDo:
Powershell version??
